## 2. Abstract

This research proposal introduces the Neuro-Systolic Tensor Framework (NSTF), a novel computational paradigm designed to optimize AMD GPUs with ROCm for large language model (LLM) inference and training. Current approaches to GPU acceleration for LLMs primarily focus on NVIDIA's CUDA ecosystem, with AMD support largely consisting of direct API translations that fail to leverage AMD-specific architectural advantages. NSTF represents a fundamental reimagining of how transformer operations map to AMD hardware by synthesizing principles from neuromorphic computing, systolic array architectures, and tensor decomposition techniques. The framework introduces three breakthrough elements: (1) a neuromorphic-inspired sparse activation tracking system that dynamically identifies and exploits sparsity patterns in attention mechanisms; (2) an adaptive tensor decomposition system with runtime accuracy feedback; and (3) an Infinity Fabric-aware memory orchestration system that treats AMD's interconnect as a computational resource rather than merely a communication channel. Through a structured implementation approach spanning four phases over 14-18 months, this research aims to demonstrate performance improvements of 35-50% for LLM workloads compared to current ROCm implementations, potentially exceeding NVIDIA CUDA performance for specific transformer operations. The project's outcomes will significantly advance the state of high-performance computing for AI, expand hardware options for LLM deployment, and establish new paradigms for GPU computing that leverage architecture-specific advantages rather than generic programming models.

## 3. Introduction and Problem Statement

### 3.1 Background

Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative technology with applications spanning natural language processing, content generation, code synthesis, and knowledge retrieval (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023). These models, characterized by their massive parameter counts ranging from billions to trillions, require substantial computational resources for both training and inference. Currently, NVIDIA GPUs with the CUDA ecosystem dominate the landscape of LLM deployment, creating a hardware monoculture that limits research accessibility, increases costs, and constrains deployment options (Dao, 2022).

AMD's GPU offerings, powered by the ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) platform, represent a potential alternative with competitive hardware specifications and an open-source software stack. However, current approaches to utilizing AMD GPUs for LLM workloads primarily rely on direct translations of CUDA code to HIP (Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability), which fails to leverage AMD-specific architectural advantages (Jia et al., 2022). This translation-based approach treats AMD hardware as a second-class target rather than exploiting its unique capabilities.

### 3.2 Problem Statement

The fundamental problem addressed by this research is the suboptimal performance of LLM workloads on AMD GPUs due to programming models that do not align with AMD's architectural strengths. Specifically:

1. **Architectural Mismatch**: Current LLM frameworks are designed around NVIDIA's architecture, with computational patterns that may not be optimal for AMD's Compute Unit organization, Wave32/Wave64 execution models, and cache hierarchy.

2. **Inefficient Memory Utilization**: AMD GPUs often feature higher memory bandwidth than their NVIDIA counterparts, but current implementations fail to leverage this advantage due to memory access patterns optimized for NVIDIA's memory subsystem.

3. **Underutilized Interconnect**: AMD's Infinity Fabric provides high-bandwidth GPU-to-GPU communication, but existing distributed LLM implementations treat it merely as a communication channel rather than an integral part of the computational fabric.

4. **Generic Optimization Approaches**: Current optimization techniques for LLMs (such as kernel fusion and quantization) are generally architecture-agnostic, missing opportunities for AMD-specific enhancements.

5. **Translation Overhead**: The HIPIFY process for converting CUDA code to HIP introduces inefficiencies and fails to restructure algorithms to match AMD's execution model.

These challenges collectively result in AMD GPUs delivering suboptimal performance for LLM workloads despite competitive hardware specifications, limiting their adoption in the AI research and deployment ecosystem.

### 3.3 Research Significance

This research proposes a paradigm shift in how LLM computations are mapped to GPU hardware by developing a framework specifically designed to leverage AMD's architectural advantages. Rather than adapting NVIDIA-optimized code to run on AMD hardware, we aim to create a computational substrate that treats AMD GPUs as a first-class target with unique capabilities to be exploited.

The significance of this research extends beyond mere performance improvements:

1. **Expanding Hardware Options**: Enabling competitive performance on AMD GPUs would diversify hardware options for LLM research and deployment, potentially reducing costs and increasing accessibility.

2. **Advancing GPU Computing Paradigms**: The proposed neuromorphic and systolic approaches represent novel computational models for GPU programming that could influence future hardware and software designs.

3. **Cross-Architecture Insights**: Techniques developed for optimizing AMD GPUs may yield insights applicable to other non-NVIDIA architectures, including emerging accelerators.

4. **Democratizing AI Research**: Improving performance on more accessible hardware platforms could democratize access to LLM capabilities for researchers with limited resources.

By addressing these challenges, this research aims to not only improve AMD GPU performance for LLMs but also to establish new paradigms for GPU computing that leverage architecture-specific advantages rather than relying on generic programming models.

## 4. Literature Review

### 4.1 Large Language Models: Computational Challenges

Large language models based on transformer architectures have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022). However, these models present significant computational challenges due to their massive parameter counts and complex attention mechanisms. Kaplan et al. (2020) established scaling laws showing that model performance continues to improve with increasing model size, driving the development of ever-larger models requiring more computational resources.

The transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) that underpins modern LLMs relies heavily on attention mechanisms and dense matrix multiplications, operations that are computationally intensive and memory-bound. Attention computation, in particular, scales quadratically with sequence length, creating a bottleneck for processing longer contexts (Tay et al., 2022).

### 4.2 GPU Acceleration for Deep Learning

GPUs have become the dominant hardware platform for deep learning due to their parallel processing capabilities and high memory bandwidth. NVIDIA's CUDA ecosystem, including libraries like cuDNN and cuBLAS, provides highly optimized implementations of common deep learning operations (Chetlur et al., 2014). These optimizations leverage NVIDIA-specific hardware features such as Tensor Cores and the CUDA programming model.

AMD's ROCm platform aims to provide similar capabilities for AMD GPUs, with libraries like MIOpen and rocBLAS offering optimized implementations of deep learning primitives (AMD, 2021). However, as noted by Jia et al. (2022), many of these implementations are direct translations of CUDA code that fail to fully leverage AMD's architectural advantages.

### 4.3 Optimization Techniques for Transformer Models

Several approaches have been developed to optimize transformer models for efficient execution. Attention optimization techniques include FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022), which improves memory access patterns through tiling and recomputation, and sparse attention mechanisms (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020) that reduce computational complexity by limiting attention to specific patterns.

Quantization techniques reduce precision requirements, enabling faster computation and lower memory usage (Dettmers et al., 2022; Frantar et al., 2023). Model compression approaches such as pruning (Frankle & Carbin, 2019) and knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) reduce model size while preserving performance.

Distributed execution frameworks like DeepSpeed (Rasley et al., 2020) and Megatron-LM (Shoeybi et al., 2019) enable training and inference of large models across multiple GPUs through model and data parallelism. However, these frameworks primarily target NVIDIA hardware and do not fully exploit the characteristics of AMD's Infinity Fabric interconnect.

### 4.4 Novel Computing Paradigms

Several alternative computing paradigms offer insights for GPU optimization. Systolic arrays, as implemented in Google's Tensor Processing Units (Jouppi et al., 2017), provide efficient matrix multiplication through a grid of processing elements with data flowing in a synchronized manner. Neuromorphic computing approaches (Davies et al., 2018) leverage sparse, event-driven computation inspired by biological neural systems.

Tensor decomposition techniques from quantum computing (Oseledets, 2011; Novikov et al., 2015) enable compact representation of large tensors through factorization into smaller components. These approaches have been applied to neural networks (Khrulkov et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2020) but not specifically optimized for AMD GPU execution.

### 4.5 AMD GPU Architecture and Optimization

AMD's CDNA architecture for compute GPUs features unique characteristics including Compute Units with Wave32/Wave64 execution modes, a multi-level cache hierarchy, and the Infinity Fabric interconnect (AMD, 2020). These features differ significantly from NVIDIA's architecture, suggesting opportunities for AMD-specific optimizations.

Limited research exists on optimizing specifically for AMD GPUs in the context of deep learning. Jia et al. (2022) identified performance gaps between CUDA and HIP implementations but focused primarily on translation issues rather than fundamental algorithmic redesigns. Optimization guides from AMD (2021) provide general principles but lack specific techniques for transformer architectures.

### 4.6 Research Gap

The literature review reveals a significant gap in research specifically addressing the optimization of transformer-based LLMs for AMD GPU architecture. While general optimization techniques exist for both transformers and AMD GPUs separately, there is limited work on developing computational models that fundamentally align transformer operations with AMD's architectural strengths.

This research aims to fill this gap by developing a novel framework that reimagines how transformer computations map to AMD hardware, drawing inspiration from alternative computing paradigms such as neuromorphic systems and systolic arrays. Rather than adapting existing NVIDIA-optimized implementations, we propose a ground-up redesign that treats AMD GPUs as a first-class target with unique capabilities to be exploited.
