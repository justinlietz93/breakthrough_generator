# Domain and Goal Summary: Cognitive Amplification System for LLMs

You're seeking to design an external software system that significantly enhances existing LLMs by providing them with advanced cognitive capabilities beyond their native architecture. This "cognitive amplifier" would overcome current LLM limitations through:

1. **Persistent Memory Architecture** - Creating durable, organized memory that persists across sessions with intelligent pruning mechanisms
2. **Dynamic Context Management** - Implementing sophisticated context handling that prevents window overflow through compression and prioritization
3. **Relevance-Based Memory Injection** - Developing systems to identify and retrieve relevant memories at appropriate moments
4. **Three-Tier Memory System** - Designing a hierarchical memory structure (short-term, medium-term, long-term) with defined information flow
5. **Autonomous Operation** - Creating goal-setting, planning, and self-reflection capabilities that enable independent operation
6. **Environmental Analysis** - Building modules to understand existing data structures and real-world constraints
7. **Constructive Capabilities** - Implementing interfaces for creating and modifying digital artifacts with quality assessment

The solution should work with existing commercial LLMs while extending their capabilities through this external framework, maintaining coherent operation indefinitely without constant human oversight.
