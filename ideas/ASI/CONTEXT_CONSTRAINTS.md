# 1) Context & Constraints Clarification

# Domain and Goals Summary

You're seeking to design a neuromorphic LLM architecture that closely mimics human brain structure and cognitive processes. This bio-inspired AI system would move beyond current monolithic designs to feature specialized components that mirror brain regions and their interconnections, with particular emphasis on:

1. Brain-like neural architecture with analogs to specific regions (prefrontal cortex, hippocampus)
2. Multi-layered memory systems with active consolidation and pruning mechanisms
3. Specialized modules for software engineering tasks (code comprehension, debugging, etc.)
4. Scientific reasoning capabilities (hypothesis generation, experimental design)
5. Human-like attention mechanisms for selective focus and context switching
6. Self-referential consciousness for metacognitive awareness
7. Balanced distributed/centralized processing architecture

The key constraint is implementability within 3-5 years using near-future technology, while maintaining high performance and improving efficiency over current LLM designs.
