3. **Hardware Limitations**: Develop software simulations of neuromorphic components that can later be replaced with specialized hardware as it becomes available.

4. **Training Data Requirements**: Start with synthetic data generation for specialized modules before moving to real-world data; implement curriculum learning approaches.

5. **Performance Validation**: Establish clear metrics for each module and the integrated system; develop benchmark tasks that specifically test brain-like capabilities.
