# 1) Context & Constraints Clarification

# Domain and Goals Summary

You're a software developer seeking to optimize AMD GPUs with ROCm for LLM inference and training, with the ambitious goal of exceeding NVIDIA's CUDA performance. You need detailed technical analysis of bottlenecks, code-level optimizations, novel architectural approaches, and practical implementation strategies specifically for transformer architectures on AMD hardware.

Your focus areas include:
- Identifying and addressing ROCm bottlenecks compared to CUDA
- Optimizing transformer operations (especially attention mechanisms and matrix multiplications)
- Leveraging AMD-specific hardware features (Infinity Fabric, Wave32/Wave64, cache hierarchy)
- Developing custom HIPIFY transformations and HIP kernels to outperform NVIDIA equivalents
- Improving memory management for multi-billion parameter models
- Implementing compiler-level and quantization optimizations tailored to AMD architecture
- Creating a prioritized development roadmap for real-world deployment
