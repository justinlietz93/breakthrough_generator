## Solution A: Neuromorphic-Inspired Sparse Attention Engine

### Underlying Logic
This solution leverages the observation that attention matrices in transformer models often contain significant redundancy, with many attention weights being near-zero and contributing minimally to the final output. By adapting principles from neuromorphic computing—where only active neurons participate in computation—we can dramatically reduce both computation and memory requirements.

### Implementation Details
The sparse attention engine would consist of:

1. **Dynamic Pruning Mechanism**: A custom HIP kernel that applies an adaptive threshold to attention weights:

```cpp
__global__ void dynamicSparseAttention(
    half* queries, half* keys, half* values, half* output,
    float* sparsityThresholds, int seqLen, int headDim) {
    
    // Calculate attention scores
    float score = calculateAttentionScore(queries, keys);
    
    // Dynamic thresholding based on layer statistics
    if (score < sparsityThresholds[blockIdx.x]) {
        return; // Skip computation for this element
    }
    
    // Process only significant attention weights
    atomicAdd(&output[outputIdx], score * values[valueIdx]);
}
```

2. **AMD-Optimized Sparse Format**: A custom sparse matrix format that aligns with AMD's SIMD width:

```cpp
struct AMDSparseAttention {
    half* values;        // Non-zero values
    int* rowIndices;     // Compressed row storage
    int* colIndices;     // Column indices
    int nnz;             // Number of non-zeros
    int wavePadding;     // Padding to optimize for Wave32/Wave64
};
```

3. **Fragmentation-Resistant Memory Manager**:

```cpp
class SparseAttentionMemoryManager {
public:
    void* allocateAttentionBuffer(size_t batchSize, size_t seqLen, float expectedSparsity) {
        // Calculate buffer size based on expected sparsity
        size_t estimatedNonZeros = batchSize * seqLen * seqLen * (1.0f - expectedSparsity);
        
        // Add padding to align with Wave32 execution
        size_t paddedSize = alignToWaveSize(estimatedNonZeros, 32);
        
        // Allocate from pre-segmented pool to reduce fragmentation
        return memoryPool.allocate(paddedSize);
    }
};
```

### Example Scenario
When processing a 2048-token sequence with 32 attention heads, traditional dense attention would require computing and storing 134 million attention weights. With typical attention patterns showing 50-80% effective sparsity, our solution would:

1. Dynamically identify the ~30-50 million significant weights
2. Store only these weights in the AMD-optimized sparse format
3. Process them using Wave32 execution for optimal efficiency
4. Reduce memory bandwidth requirements by ~60%

### Synergy with AMD Architecture
This solution specifically leverages:
- AMD's Wave32 execution mode, which is more efficient for sparse irregular computations than NVIDIA's 32-thread warps
- AMD's higher memory bandwidth, which helps when accessing the sparse data structures
- AMD's cache hierarchy, which we optimize for by carefully designing the sparse format's memory layout

### Pros and Cons
**Pros:**
- Reduces memory bandwidth requirements by 40-60%
- Decreases computation by similar proportions
- Scales better with sequence length (complexity closer to O(n) than O(n²))
- Particularly effective for long-context LLMs

**Cons:**
- Introduces some overhead for sparsity determination
- Requires careful tuning of sparsity thresholds
- May slightly impact model accuracy if thresholds are too aggressive

## Solution B: Quantum-Inspired Tensor Decomposition for Matrix Operations

### Underlying Logic
Large weight matrices in LLMs contain significant redundancy that can be exploited through tensor decomposition techniques. By adapting methods from quantum tensor networks, we can represent these matrices as products of smaller tensors, dramatically reducing parameter count while preserving representational capacity.

### Implementation Details
The tensor decomposition library would include:

1. **Automatic Tensor-Train Decomposition**:

```cpp
std::vector<Tensor> tensorTrainDecompose(const Tensor& weightMatrix, 
                                        float compressionRatio,
                                        int maxRank) {
    // Initialize tensor cores
    std::vector<Tensor> cores;
    
    // SVD-based decomposition with adaptive rank selection
    Tensor U, S, V;
    for (int i = 0; i < weightMatrix.dims() - 1; i++) {
        std::tie(U, S, V) = truncatedSVD(weightMatrix, maxRank);
        
        // Determine optimal rank based on singular value distribution
        int optimalRank = determineRankFromSingularValues(S, compressionRatio);
        
        // Create core tensor and add to cores
        Tensor core = U.slice(0, optimalRank);
        cores.push_back(reshapeTensorForTTFormat(core));
        
        // Update remaining weight matrix
        weightMatrix = matmul(diagonalMatrix(S.slice(0, optimalRank)), V.slice(0, optimalRank));
    }
    
    cores.push_back(weightMatrix);
    return cores;
}
```

2. **Distributed Tensor Contraction using Infinity Fabric**:

```cpp
__global__ void distributedTensorContraction(
    half* tensorA, half* tensorB, half* output,
    int* tensorDims, int* contractionDims) {
    
    // Compute local contraction indices based on GPU ID
    int gpuId = hipGetDeviceId();
    int startIdx = calculateStartIndex(tensorDims, gpuId);
    int endIdx = calculateEndIndex(tensorDims, gpuId);
    
    // Perform local tensor contraction
    for (int i = startIdx; i < endIdx; i++) {
        // Contraction logic
    }
    
    // Use Infinity Fabric for efficient cross-GPU reduction
    crossGPUReduce(output, tensorDims[0] * tensorDims[1]);
}
```

3. **Mixed-Precision Tensor Operations**:

```cpp
template<typename T>
__global__ void mixedPrecisionMatmul(
    T* A, T* B, float* C,
    int M, int N, int K) {
    
    // Use FP16 for multiplication
    half localA = __float2half(A[idx]);
    half localB = __float2half(B[idx]);
    
    // Use FP32 for accumulation
    float acc = 0.0f;
    for (int i = 0; i < K; i++) {
        acc += __half2float(__hmul(localA, localB));
    }
    
    // Store result
    C[outIdx] = acc;
}
```

### Example Scenario
For a 175B parameter model with embedding dimension 12288, each weight matrix in the feed-forward layers would be approximately 12288×49152 (604 million parameters). Using Tensor-Train decomposition with ranks [32, 64, 32]:

1. Original matrix: 604M parameters
2. Decomposed representation: ~5M parameters (>99% reduction)
3. Forward pass computation: Series of smaller matrix multiplications
4. Memory requirement: Reduced from 1.2GB to ~10MB per layer
5. Accuracy: Maintained within 2% of original performance

### Synergy with AMD Architecture
This approach leverages:
- AMD's Infinity Fabric for efficient distribution of tensor contractions
- Superior FP16 accumulation capabilities in CDNA architecture
- Higher memory bandwidth for the increased memory access patterns of decomposed operations

### Pros and Cons
**Pros:**
- Dramatic reduction in parameter count (70-99%)
- Significantly reduced memory footprint
- Enables fitting larger models in the same memory
- Potential inference speedup due to reduced computation

**Cons:**
- Increased algorithmic complexity
- Some accuracy trade-off (typically 1-2%)
- Training requires specialized optimization techniques

## Solution C: Systolic Array Virtualization for Transformer Operations

### Underlying Logic
Systolic arrays—the hardware architecture powering Google's TPUs—excel at matrix multiplication by creating a grid of processing elements that pass data in a
