# NSTF Implementation Elaborations

## Technical Feasibility Details

### Systolic Array Virtualization
The virtualized systolic array concept is implementable today using AMD's Compute Unit (CU) architecture. Each CU contains multiple SIMD units that can be programmatically organized to simulate systolic data flow patterns. The implementation would use HIP's workgroup and wavefront primitives to create the data movement patterns characteristic of systolic arrays.

For example, to implement a 64Ã—64 virtual systolic array on an MI250:
```cpp
// Pseudo-implementation of virtual systolic cell mapping
void mapVirtualSystolicArray(int rows, int cols, int wave_size) {
    // Calculate workgroup dimensions
    int wg_size_x = (cols + 7) / 8;  // 8 cells per wavefront in x-dimension
    int wg_size_y = (rows + 7) / 8;  // 8 cells per wavefront in y-dimension
    
    // Calculate number of wavefronts needed
    int num_waves = (wg_size_x * wg_size_y * 64) / wave_size;
    
    // Configure kernel launch parameters
    hipLaunchKernelGGL(
        systolicKernel,
        dim3(wg_size_x, wg_size_y),
        dim3(wave_size / 8, 8),  // 8 threads in y-dimension per wavefront
        0, 0,
        d_input, d_weights, d_output, rows, cols
    );
}
```

### Neuromorphic Activation Tracking
This can be implemented using a sliding window approach that maintains activation statistics across multiple inference steps. The implementation would use shared memory to track activation patterns and predict future activations:

```cpp
// Tracking activation patterns across attention operations
template<int HEAD_SIZE, int SEQ_LEN>
__global__ void trackAttentionActivations(
    float* attention_scores,
    float* activation_history,
    int history_length
) {
    // Each thread handles one attention score
    int seq_idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int head_idx = blockIdx.y;
    
    if (seq_idx < SEQ_LEN) {
        // Get current activation
        float activation = attention_scores[head_idx * SEQ_LEN + seq_idx];
        
        // Update activation history (circular buffer)
        int history_idx = (current_step % history_length);
        activation_history[history_idx * SEQ_LEN + seq_idx] = activation;
        
        // Predict future activations using simple exponential smoothing
        float predicted = 0.0f;
        for (int i = 0; i < history_length; i++) {
            int idx = ((current_step - i + history_length) % history_length);
            predicted += activation_history[idx * SEQ_LEN + seq_idx] * weights[i];
        }
        
        // Store prediction for next iteration
        predicted_activations[seq_idx] = predicted;
    }
}
```

## Performance Expectations

Based on preliminary analysis, the NSTF approach could yield the following performance improvements:

1. **Matrix Multiplication Operations**: 30-45% speedup over standard HIP implementations by leveraging the virtualized systolic arrays and Wave32/64 adaptation.

2. **Attention Mechanisms**: 40-60% speedup through the neuromorphic sparse activation tracking, particularly for longer sequence lengths where sparsity patterns become more pronounced.

3. **Memory Bandwidth Utilization**: 25-35% improvement through the Infinity Fabric-aware memory orchestration, especially in multi-GPU configurations.

4. **Overall LLM Inference**: 35-50% end-to-end speedup for models like LLaMA-7B and GPT-J-6B compared to current ROCm implementations.

These estimates are based on the architectural advantages of AMD GPUs and the specific optimizations proposed in the NSTF framework.

## Implementation Priorities

If you need to prioritize development efforts for maximum impact, focus on these areas first:

1. **Memory Hierarchy Optimization**: This provides the most immediate gains with relatively straightforward implementation. Focus on optimizing data movement patterns to match AMD's cache hierarchy.

2. **Systolic Array Virtualization**: Implement this for matrix multiplication operations, which dominate LLM computation time. Start with a simplified version that handles the most common matrix dimensions in transformer models.

3. **Sparse Activation Tracking**: Implement a basic version that identifies and exploits common attention patterns. This can provide significant speedups for inference workloads.

4. **Infinity Fabric Orchestration**: For multi-GPU setups, this will provide substantial scaling improvements with relatively modest implementation effort.

## Hardware-Specific Optimizations

For specific AMD GPU generations:

- **MI100**: Focus on Wave64 execution and memory coalescing optimizations. The L2 cache is particularly important for this generation.

- **MI200**: Leverage the improved Infinity Fabric bandwidth and Matrix Core instructions. The dual-GCD design requires careful workload balancing.

- **MI300**: Take advantage of the unified memory architecture and enhanced Matrix Cores. The increased cache sizes allow for more aggressive tiling strategies.

## Integration with Existing Frameworks

The NSTF can be integrated with PyTorch through custom CUDA extensions that redirect to our optimized HIP implementations:

```python
# Example of PyTorch integration
import torch
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load

# Load the NSTF custom kernels
nstf = load(
    name="nstf_pytorch",
    sources=["nstf_pytorch.cpp", "nstf_kernels.hip"],
    extra_cflags=["-O3"],
    extra_cuda_cflags=["--gpu-architecture=gfx90a"],
    with_cuda=True
)

# Replace PyTorch's attention implementation with NSTF
class NSTFAttention(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_heads):
        super().__init__()
        self.embed_dim = embed_dim
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.head_dim = embed_dim // num_heads
        
        # Standard PyTorch parameters
        self.q_proj = torch.nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim)
        self.k_proj = torch.nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim)
        self.v_proj = torch.nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim)
        self.out_proj = torch.nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Standard projection
        q = self.q_proj(x)
        k = self.k_proj(x)
        v = self.v_proj(x)
        
        # Use NSTF optimized attention
        output = nstf.optimized_attention(
            q, k, v, 
            self.num_heads, 
            self.head_dim
        )
        
        return self.out_proj(output)
```

This approach allows for incremental adoption without requiring a complete rewrite of existing models.
